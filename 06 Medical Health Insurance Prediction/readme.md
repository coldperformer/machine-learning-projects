# Introduction

- **Health insurance** is a **necessity** nowadays, and almost every individual has a link with a government or private health insurance company. 

- Factors determining the amount of insurance vary from company to company. 

- Also, **people** in **rural areas** are **unaware** that the government of India provides **free health insurance** to those who are **below** the **poverty line**. 

- It is a very complex method, and some rural people either buy some private health insurance or do not invest money in health insurance at all. 

- Apart from this, people can be fooled easily about the amount of the insurance and may unnecessarily buy some expensive health insurance.
